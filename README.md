# Tidy Tuesday Solutions by Seshadhri

My solutions to various Tidy Tuesday datasets.
Each solution will have a RMarkdown file and an HTML file so users can visualise the results in whichever they find appropriate.

Some notes:
1. The Netflix tidy tuesday problem - I couldn't finish it in full due to a lack of time.
