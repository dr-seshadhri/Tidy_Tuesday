# Correlation between various attributes among each other

I might run a Boruta to see which features are important in influencing danceability - specifically from characteristics such as loudness, major key, energy, duration, mode etc.

```{r}
taylor_boruta <- taylor_all_songs %>% dplyr::select(album_name, track_name, c(12:28))


# Drop non-numeric/non-feature columns before running Boruta
boruta_data <- taylor_boruta %>%
  dplyr::select(-track_name, -album_name) 
boruta_data <- na.omit(boruta_data)

# Run Boruta
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
boruta_result <- Boruta(
  formula = danceability ~ .,
  data = boruta_data,
  doTrace = 0,
  maxRuns = 2000
)
?Boruta()

print(boruta_result)
plot(boruta_result, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.7)

# Get confirmed important features
impt_attributes <- getSelectedAttributes(boruta_result, withTentative = TRUE)
print(impt_attributes)

```

# Find out the correlation between the important attributes and danceability

```{r}
important_vars <- boruta_data %>%
  dplyr::select(all_of(impt_attributes))  
cor_matrix <- cor(important_vars, use = "complete.obs")
cor_matrix <- round(cor_matrix, digits = 2)
print(cor_matrix)
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "lower", tl.cex = 0.8, addCoef.col ="black", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)
```

# Linear Regression

```{r}

lm_model <- lm(danceability ~ ., data = boruta_data)
print(summary(lm_model))
plot(lm_model)

# Explanation of the four plots (from ChatGPT so be wary)

📈 1. Residuals vs Fitted
What it shows: Residuals (errors) vs predicted values.
You're looking for: A random scatter of points around the horizontal line (0).

✅ Good: Cloud of dots, no pattern → model fits well.

❌ Bad: Curves, funnels, or patterns → non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.

TL;DR: If this plot looks like a sad banana, your model isn’t fully linear.

📉 2. Normal Q-Q Plot
What it shows: Do your residuals follow a normal distribution?
You're looking for: Points hugging the 45° line.

✅ Good: Almost all dots are on or near the line.

❌ Bad: Points deviate sharply at the ends → skewed errors or outliers.

TL;DR: If it curves like a Taylor Swift bridge, your residuals might be a little dramatic.

🌡️ 3. Scale-Location (aka Spread-Location)
What it shows: Do residuals have equal variance across fitted values?
You're looking for: A flat horizontal line with evenly spread points.

✅ Good: Dots are evenly spread.

❌ Bad: Dots fan out or funnel in → your residuals aren’t playing fair (heteroscedasticity).

TL;DR: If it looks like a trumpet, your errors are not consistent.

🔎 4. Residuals vs Leverage
What it shows: Influential observations that might be messing with your model.
You're looking for: Points with high leverage and large residuals (check for red Cook’s distance circles).

✅ Good: Most points are in the middle, none flying solo in the corners.

❌ Bad: One point way off in the top-right? That’s your diva outlier.

TL;DR: If it looks like one data point's trying to hijack your tour bus, investigate it.
